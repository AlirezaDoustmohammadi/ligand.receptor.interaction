Intercellular interactions and cell–cell communication are critical to regulating cell functions, especially in normal immune cells and immunotherapies. Ligand–receptor pairs mediating these cell–cell interactions can be identified using diverse experimental and computational approaches. 

Here, we reconstructed the intercellular interaction network between Mus musculus immune cells using publicly available receptor–ligand interaction databases and gene expression data from the immunological genome project. 
This reconstructed network accounts for 50,317 unique interactions between 16 cell types between 731 receptor–ligand pairs. 

Analysis of this network shows that cells of hematopoietic lineages use fewer communication pathways for interacting with each other, while nonhematopoietic stromal cells use the most network communications. We further observe that the WNT, BMP, and LAMININ pathways are the most significant contributors to the overall number of cell–cell interactions among the various pathways in the reconstructed communication network. 

The analyses done are part of a paper published in the Journal of <i>Biotechnology and Bioengineering</i> in May 2023 titled "<b>Reconstructing the cell-cell interaction network among mouse immune cells</b>"
